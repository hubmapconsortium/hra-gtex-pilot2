# CFDE IU-GTEx
## NIH Title: CFDE: Map and Harmonize Data for Heart and Lung

## Primary Deliverables

- List of Datasets for Processing: [Dataset List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HyUCq8n2zOozOck_Nvrp0RNd1TL4iK9I0C5cb9DuHhY/edit#gid=2095065964)
- Datasets Registered with the RUI: [Demo](https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/hra-gtex-pilot2/ccf-eui.html)

## Primary Tasks:

1. Select CxGM data from at least two rich single cell data sources (GTEx and HuBMAP, and at least one additional published reference resource, and including any additional mapped CFDE single cell data if available) that have been spatially registered using the existing CCF Registration User Interface (RUI, https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf-ui/rui) and compile a combined single cell data source for at least two tissue types (e.g., lung and heart);
2. Harmonize and annotate these data using Azimuth, CellTypist, or similar tools;
3. Use these mappings/comparison results to further iteratively enhance the registration process and accuracy, and help prioritize capture of meaningful sample metadata, mapping additional GTEx tissues as test cases;
4. Present results to other teams within the CFDE  as well as teams working on major human atlas papers such as Tabula Sapiens and/or data portal teams from HCA, cellxgene, NeMO, etc.) for comments.
